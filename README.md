- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `measurement_theory_notes.md`: Measurement theory and validation details
- `technical_writeup.md`: Technical report and reflection
- `source_assets.md`: Description of project source assets
- `qst_data/`: Synthetic measurement datasets and metadata
- `single_qubit/`: Reconstructed density matrices and validation metrics
- `density_matrix_htmls/`: Interactive density matrix visualizations

## How to Run
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run the notebook using Jupyter.

## Notes
This project uses simulated data and does not involve experimental hardware.
